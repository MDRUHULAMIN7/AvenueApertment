## Five Bullet Points:
- Apartment Details: Each apartment listing  provide a detailed information such as square footage, floor plan layout, lease terms (e.g., month-to-month, annual), and any additional fees or deposits required.
- Utility Information: Information about utilities included in the rent (e.g., water, trash) and those the tenant is responsible for (e.g., electricity, internet, cable).
- High-Resolution Images:High-resolution images capture the details and ambiance of each apartment accurately, providing users with a realistic preview of the space.
- Community Engagement: Encouraging community engagement through reviews allows residents to share their experiences, recommendations, and concerns, creating a sense of community.
- Responsive Design:The website should be accessible and user-friendly across a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
